Reformulate this prompt in a way that still works but becomes shorter (fewer words lead to lower costs per API call):

Original prompt: "Could you kindly inform me which color or shade is commonly seen for the specific product I am 
referring to at this time? The product I am thinking of is: 'banana'"

-> Shortened prompt: "What is the common color of a banana?"

You are building a TODO application with Spring Boot. You want the user to enter a heading when creating a new list. 
Your app should populate the new TODO list with 10 meaningful TODO item suggestions. How would you construct the text
for the prompt? What could be a concise, precise, but unambiguous formulation for ChatGPT? Use the prompt in ChatGPT 
and verify that it works. 

-> Generate 10 meaningful TODO items for a list titled 'Project Launch'.
