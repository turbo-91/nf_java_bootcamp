// RESEARCH

// Give an example of a situation where using a Set would be more appropriate than using an ArrayList. Explain your decision.
//
// A Set is more appropriate when you need to store a collection of unique values, such as ensuring no duplicate usernames in a user registration system.
// Using an ArrayList would require manually checking for duplicates before adding each element, which is inefficient. A Set automatically prevents duplicates,
// simplifying the code and improving performance. For example, adding usernames to a HashSet ensures each is stored only once without additional logic.


// Give an example of a situation where using a Map would be more appropriate than using an ArrayList or a Set. Explain your decision.
//
// A Map is more appropriate when you need to associate keys with values, such as storing user IDs (keys) and their corresponding names (values). Neither ArrayList
// nor Set provides a way to directly associate pairs of data, making retrieval or modification inefficient. A Map allows you to quickly look up a value based on
// its key, such as retrieving a userâ€™s name by their ID. For example, using a HashMap<Integer, String> can map user IDs to names, ensuring fast lookups.


// Name another class in the Java Collections Framework, besides ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap. 
//
// Another class in the Java Collections Framework is the LinkedList. It is a doubly-linked list implementation that allows efficient insertion and deletion
// of elements at both ends, making it suitable for use cases like implementing queues or stacks.
