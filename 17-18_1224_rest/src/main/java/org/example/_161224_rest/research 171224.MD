What alternatives(Libraries) are there to MockRestServiceServer for testing API calls?

Alternatives to MockRestServiceServer include WireMock, which provides a realistic 
mock HTTP server for API stubbing, and Mockito, which can mock RestTemplate for unit testing 
API calls directly. Another option is OkHttp MockWebServer, a lightweight server for 
simulating HTTP responses. These tools offer flexibility depending on your need for 
unit or integration testing and the level of realism required in your mocks.

How can you advise the MockRestServiceServer to expect multiple of the same Request? 

To configure MockRestServiceServer to handle multiple identical requests, use 
ExpectedCount.times(n) to expect an exact number of requests or ExpectedCount.atLeast(n)
to allow a minimum number of requests. This ensures the mock server validates the
repeated API calls during the test. Additional request matchers, such as 
requestTo(containsString("/path")), can help fine-tune expectations if needed.
